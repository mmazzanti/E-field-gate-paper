@article{MonroeOTOC,
	Abstract = {Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout an entire system. This concept accompanies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum systems, and has recently emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing chaos in black holes1--4. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process5,6. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit, providing an unambiguous test for whether scrambling has occurred, while simultaneously measuring an OTOC. We engineer quantum scrambling processes through a tunable three-qubit unitary operation as part of a seven-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities are typically about 80 per cent, and enable us to experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement.},

  abstract = {The prevalent approach to executing quantum algorithms on quantum computers is to break-down the algorithms to a concatenation of universal gates, typically single and two-qubit gates. However such a decomposition results in long gate sequences which are exponential in the qubit register size. Furthermore, gate fidelities tend to decrease when acting in larger qubit registers. Thus high-fidelity implementations in large qubit registers is still a prominent challenge. Here we propose and investigate multi-qubit entangling gates for trapped-ions. Our gates couple many qubits at once, allowing to decrease the total number of gates used while retaining a high gate fidelity. Our method employs all of the normal-modes of motion of the ion chain, which allows to operate outside of the adiabatic regime and at rates comparable to the secular ion-trapping frequency. Furthermore we extend our method for generating Hamiltonians which are suitable for quantum analog simulations, such as a nearest-neighbour spin Hamiltonian or the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {We show that the physical system consisting of trapped ions interacting with lasers may undergo a rich variety of quantum phase transitions. By changing the laser intensities and polarizations the dynamics of the internal states of the ions can be controlled, in such a way that an Ising or Heisenberg-like interaction is induced between effective spins. Our scheme allows us to build an analogue quantum simulator of spin systems with trapped ions, and observe and analyze quantum phase transitions with unprecedented opportunities for the measurement and manipulation of spins.},
